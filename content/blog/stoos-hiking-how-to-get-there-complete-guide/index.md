The Stoos trail in Switzerland is a scenic alpine hike known for its sweeping views of the Swiss Alps and Lake Lucerne. Starting with a ride on the world's steepest funicular, this trail offers both adventure and stunning natural beauty.

&nbsp;

Enjoy every single moment in **Stoos**; you will fall in love.

## ‚úà Schwyz, Stoos

You will arrive in the city of Schwyz, nestled beneath the mountain, where your adventure begins. The village of Stoos sits above Schwyz, and from there, you can purchase your funicular **ticket** on-site, but I recommend buying it online to skip the line and head straight to the funicular for a smoother experience.

If you travel **by car**, you can find parking spots available for around 1 CHF per hour.

Another option is to travel by train **from Zurich**, which takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes.

### ‚úà Hiking

The hike begins after taking the world's steepest funicular, where you can follow the trail **from Klingenstock to Fronalpstock**, though it can be done in the opposite direction as well.

I highly recommend starting this way, as you'll be rewarded with stunning views of **Lake Lucerne** at a certain point along the hike, making the experience even more enjoyable.

The Stoos funicular, known as the world's steepest funicular railway, is an engineering marvel that provides a thrilling ascent to the village of Stoos from the valley below. Opened in 2017, this funicular features a remarkable incline of up to 110% (or 47 degrees), making it a unique attraction for visitors.

&nbsp;

The journey begins in the town of Schwyz, where passengers board the funicular for a scenic ride that takes about five minutes. As it climbs, the funicular offers stunning views of the surrounding landscapes, including the picturesque Lake Lucerne and the majestic peaks of the Swiss Alps. The design of the funicular is notable for its innovative technology, which allows it to maintain stability and safety on such a steep gradient.

&nbsp;

The funicular can carry up to 100 passengers at a time, making it accessible for both tourists and locals. The ride is not just a means of transportation but an experience in itself, as the cabin glides smoothly up the slope, providing breathtaking vistas at every turn.
